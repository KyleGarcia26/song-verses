Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah

You got issues that I won’t mention for now
’Cause we're fallin’ apart

Listen Harder buildin' trust from a distance 
I think we should rule out commitment for now 'Cause we're fallin' apart Leavin' 
You're just doing that to get even Don't pick up the pieces, 
just leave it for now They keep fallin' apart yeah



Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
